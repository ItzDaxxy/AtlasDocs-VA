  "tuning_notes": "- This table is primarily active at lower RPM and during cold engine operation when TGVs remain closed\n- TGVs typically open above ~3500-4000 RPM, shifting blend toward the \"TGVs Open\" tables\n- Conservative timing in this table helps prevent knock during cold start conditions\n- When tuning, focus first on the cells active during your typical operating conditions\n- Use datalog to identify which load/RPM cells are most frequently accessed\n- Always tune with knock monitoring enabled and DAM observed",
  "warnings": "- Excessive ignition advance can cause detonation (knock), leading to engine damage\n- Monitor Feedback Knock Correction and Fine Knock Learn during tuning\n- Any sustained knock correction indicates timing should be reduced\n- DAM dropping below 1.0 indicates the ECU is reducing advance due to detected knock\n- Always use quality fuel meeting minimum octane requirements (91+ AKI recommended)\n\n---\n*Last updated: 2024-12-14*\n*Platform: VA WRX MT (FA20DIT)*",
