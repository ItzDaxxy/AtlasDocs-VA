# Throttle

Electronic throttle control (ETC) tables.

## Overview

Throttle tables control:
- Pedal-to-throttle mapping
- Throttle response curves
- Drive-by-wire behavior
- Throttle limiters
- Cruise control integration

## Subcategories

*Expand the Throttle category in Atlas and take a screenshot to populate this section.*

## Tables

| Table Name | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| *TBD* | | |

## Related Systems

- **Engine**: Throttle affects load
- **Airflow**: Throttle position affects airflow
- **VDC**: Traction control can limit throttle
- **Transmission**: Throttle blips for rev matching

## Notes

- FA20DIT uses electronic throttle (no cable)
- Pedal position ≠ throttle position (non-linear mapping)
- "Sport" modes typically steepen the response curve
